In this task, we studied the spread of covid-19 among the countries and its impact on the global economy. We saw that the outbreak of covid-19 resulted in the highest number of covid-19 cases and deaths in the united states. One major reason behind this is the stringency index of the United States. It is comparatively low according to the population. We also analyzed how the GDP per capita of every country was affected during the outbreak of covid-19.
